# Models
Models are created using the tensorflow, GAN has generator for generating new images and discriminator for classifying whether the generated image is fake or real.
These two models will train simultaniously by passing the output of one model to another.  

## Generator model

I have used Conv2dTranspose and Conv2d for convolutional layers for better performance.
This model takes 100 random values as input and produces 64x64 image of having 3 channels.
Model produces the image in BGR format and the value are in range (-1,1).
### Conv2D  
Extracts features from input data by sliding a filter over the input, producing a feature map that highlights patterns.
### Conv2DTranspose
Used for upsampling by increasing the spatial resolution of the input, helping to reconstruct or enlarge feature maps.
### Model structure

# Discriminator model

Discriminator has Conv2D and SeparableConv2D to extract features present in the image.
Model takes the input of image size 64x64x3 and values in range(-1,1).
The output of the model is in range(0,1) and 0,1 represents fake and original images simultaniously.
### SeparableConv2D
It is a convolutional layer that performs depthwise separable convolution, separating spatial and depth-wise convolutions for more parameter efficiency and reduced computational cost.

# Responsible Use and Disclaimers
## Ethical Considerations
We acknowledge the ethical considerations associated with fake face generation and are committed to the responsible and ethical use of our model.

## Avoiding Misuse
Users are reminded not to use the generated faces for malicious purposes, including deception, spreading misinformation, or any activities that violate ethical standards.

## Informed Consent
Ensure informed consent before using generated faces, especially in sensitive or commercial contexts, respecting the privacy and rights of individuals.

## Data Privacy
Rest assured that our model does not store or use personal information without explicit consent, prioritizing user privacy and data protection.

# Limitations and Disadvantages
## Potential for Misuse
Acknowledge the potential for misuse of generated faces and emphasize the importance of using the model responsibly.

## Bias and Fairness
we are producing the faces with the size of 64x64 pixels due to lack of resources, so the produced images may not be clear and some of the faces are will not looks like real.

## Imperfections in Generation
Our model may not always produce perfect or realistic faces. It has limitations in terms of diversity and quality.
